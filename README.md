# ASSIGNMENT
FOR PROBLEM 1:
1. Product Overview
>The product is a vulnerability scanning tool for container images. It scans containers, identifies vulnerabilities (with severity levels), and presents this data in a way that helps users prioritize fixes.

2. Objectives
>Detect and list vulnerabilities in container images.
>Show severity levels (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
>Help users filter and prioritize which images to fix.
>Provide an intuitive UI to manage thousands of images efficiently.

3. Target Users
>DevOps teams
>Security engineers
>Infrastructure and operations teams

4. Key Features
>Image Scanning Dashboard
>Displays a summary of scanned container images.
>Highlights vulnerable images by severity.
>Image Details View

5. Functional Requirements
>Scheduled and manual scans.
>Store historical scan data.
>Role-based access control.


FOR PROBLEM 2:
1. Setup Local K8s Cluster
Minikube: Simple and widely used.
Kind (Kubernetes IN Docker): Lightweight and fast.
K3s: Minimal Kubernetes distribution.
MicroK8s: Good for Ubuntu-based systems.

3. Install a Kubernetes Security Scanner
Recommended Tool: Kubescape


curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubescape/kubescape/master/install.sh | /bin/bash

Alternative Tools:
kube-bench (CIS Benchmark)
trivy k8s --report summary (Aqua Security)

3. Deliverable
A JSON file like results.json containing the findings.

FOR PROBLEM 3:
TO CREATE A SIMPLE GOLANG WEBPAGE

// main.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "time"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Current Date & Time: %s", time.Now().Format(time.RFC1123))
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}


FOR DEPLOYMENT:

# deployment.yaml
